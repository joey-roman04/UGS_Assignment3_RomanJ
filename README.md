# University of Texas Quiz
The website I created is a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of UT. The user clicks the link and is taken to the introduction page, where they are prompted to begin the quiz. Once the user presses the 'Start Quiz' button, they are taken to a page with the first question. Each page has a question that the user selects and then submits; once submitted, the website takes the user to the next question. After answering five questions, once the user hits submit on the last question, the user will be taken to the results page where they receive their result. The results vary depending on how many questions the user got correct; if the user gets 4 or 5 questions correct, a picture of Bevo will pop up, and the phrase 'Your a true UT fan' will pop up. If the user gets 2 or 3 questions correct, an image and phrase will pop up telling the user that they could have done better. Given they answer 0 or 1 question correctly, an image of a thumbs down and a phrase will pop up insulting their UT knowledge.                                                                           Source: I utilized ChatGPT's code tutor to help me learn how to code and check my code. Additionally, when my code wasn't working, the 'code tutor' would walk me through ways to diagnose the problem.
